# FastLed-Demo-Example
I am just starting to learn too program in IDE and Python with a hint of C++.
This is the code I am working on.
It is from the FastLED DemoReel100.ino Example.
I have made some changes to experiment with the patterns.
I am just a beginner at this so please bear with me.
Thank you for any comments you may have.



Update 05/02/2021
Thank you for all of your suggestions.
This is the final code - all changes have been made.
Everything is working great!
