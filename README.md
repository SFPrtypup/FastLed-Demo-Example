# FastLed-Demo-Example
I am just starting to learn too program in IDE and Python with a hint of C++.
This is the code I am working on.
It is from the FastLED DemoReel100.ino Example.
I have made some changes to experiment with the patterns.
I am just a beginner at this so please bear with me.
Thank you for any comments you may have.
